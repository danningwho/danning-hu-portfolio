# User research

## Target audience
My target audience are those ages 18-30 and leaning towards U.S. individuals given the context of my work. I wrote in the first section of my 
My approach to identifying representative individuals:
- I think this came pretty easy given my target audience. I was lucky that I have access to students with varying backgrounds and those who are in the workforce but are within the age range.
- As long as they 1, read news online, or 2, interact with online platforms and content, I counted them as qualified.

## Interview script
- Who do you think my audience is? Is that clear from my work so far? --> Based on feedback from part 1, I wanted to narrow it further and ideally target an age group.
- Was there anything you didn’t understand?
- What recommendations do you have/general comments do you have?

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|  Target audience captured	| Who do you think my audience is? Is that clear from my work so far? |
|  Clear flow of story	| Was there anything you didn’t understand? |
| What did I miss? | What recommendations do you have/general comments do you have? |


## Interview findings
| Role      	| Who do you think is the intended audience for this?                              	| Does the content included make sense?                                             	| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?                                                                 	| Is there anything you would change or do differently?                                   	|
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student - MUD | I guess general audience but leaning towards younger folks                     	| Mostly. I think you just need to add a bit more content.                         	| I was not aware of there being misinformation during the time periods you mentioned, like in 2016, so I don’t completely know what you are referring to. | I would add more examples of misinformation that occurred during the election/covid.    	|
| Student - PPM | Yeah, I think this was meant for someone around our age                        	| Makes sense overall                                                              	| Not really, just some of the charts can be hard to understand. The covid chart needs a bit more information like a clearer title to show why misinformation had an impact. | A timeline of events? I don’t know how or what you would put on this.                   	|
| Biochemist	| People who want to learn more about generative AI and its effects on how we consume media and perceive the world | Yes, easy flow and clear imagery and direction, images provide a visual stimulus to bolster effective reading comprehension | Nothing too surprising, but definitely informative                                                                      	| n/a, enjoyed the links to the articles!                                                 	|




# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.  
| Research Synthesis                                       	| Anticipated changes for Part III                                                                                               	|
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Additional contextual clues for the readers to anchor better with the events described in the website | Adding 2 examples of misinformation in the 2016 misinformation example and COVID-19 example                                 	|
| Cleaning up the graphs                                   	| Highlight what I want to point out for the COVID-19 misinformation graph — change the title to “Number of Fake News Articles coincide with spikes in new cases” Additionally, consider adding COVID-19 new cases either in a separate or same graph. Need to think about how to implement that. |


- Additionally, while this was not mentioned in the user interviews, I implemented a fake article at the start of the story as a hook/example. I need to call back to this at the end:
    - Tie on how the reader reacted to what they would do if they saw that article to specific actions, ending it with "think twice before you share"
